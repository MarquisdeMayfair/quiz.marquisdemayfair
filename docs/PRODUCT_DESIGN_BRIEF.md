## Copyright Independence Statement

### Our Commitment to Originality

The Marquis de Mayfair Persona Assessment contains **zero content** derived from BDSMtest.org or any other existing BDSM assessment tool. Our legal independence is ensured through:

1. **Construct-First Methodology**: We identify psychological constructs from peer-reviewed academic literature, then write original items to measure those constructs.

## Question Development Methodology

### Step 1: Construct Identification

We begin by identifying psychological constructs from the academic literature. For example:

**Construct**: "Cognitive relief through power surrender"
**Source**: Yost & Hunter (2012) finding that submissives report psychological relief through transfer of decision-making responsibility

### Step 2: Construct Operationalization

We translate academic constructs into measurable self-report items:

**Construct**: Cognitive relief through power surrender
**Question**: "The idea of surrendering all decision-making during sex—having nothing to do but feel and obey—creates a profound sense of relief."

### Step 3: Dimension Mapping

Each question maps to exactly one of our 16 dimensions:

- Dominance
- Submission
- Sensory Dominance (Sadism)
- Sensory Reception (Masochism)
- Bondage Artistry (Rigger)
- Bondage Reception (Rope Bottom)
- Exhibition
- Witness (Voyeur)
- Primal Pursuit (Hunter)
- Primal Flight (Prey)
- Total Authority (Owner)
- Total Surrender (Property)
- Nurturing Authority (Caregiver)
- Nurtured State (Dependent)
- Role Fluidity (Switch)
- Devotional Service

### Step 4: Weight Assignment

Questions receive weights (0.8× to 1.5×) based on:

1. **Centrality**: How central is this item to the construct?
2. **Discriminant Validity**: Does this item differentiate between orientations?
3. **Social Desirability**: Lower weights for socially desirable responses
4. **Face Validity**: Higher weights for clear, unambiguous items

### Step 5: Reverse-Item Inclusion

Some questions are reverse-scored to:
- Detect acquiescence bias
- Improve construct validity
- Increase respondent attention

---

## Scoring Algorithm

### Formula

```
dimensionScore = (Σ weightedResponses / maxPossibleScore) × 100

Where:
  weightedResponse = (response × weight) for normal items
  weightedResponse = ((6 - response) × weight) for reversed items
  maxPossibleScore = Σ (5 × weight) for all dimension questions
```

### Normalization

Scores are normalized to 0-100 based only on answered questions, allowing for:
- Graceful handling of skipped questions
- Fair comparison across dimensions with different question counts
- Consistent percentile interpretation

### Archetype Assignment

Primary archetype = Dimension with highest normalized score
Secondary archetype = Dimension with second-highest score

## Cold Reading Principles

### Barnum Effect Application

Our archetype descriptions use established cold reading techniques:

1. **Universal Specificity**: Statements that feel personal but apply broadly
   - "You have likely sensed for years that..."
   - "People throughout your life have probably commented on..."

2. **Flattering Insights**: Frame traits positively
   - Not: "You want to hurt people"
   - But: "You understand that intensity is a language"

3. **Hidden Depth Implication**: Suggest undiscovered layers
   - "There is a quality within you that the world often misunderstands"

4. **Reader Validation**: Make them feel seen
   - "This is not weakness—it is recognition of something authentic"

5. **Future Orientation**: Provide growth path
   - "Your path requires wisdom..."
   - "Your gift lies in..."

---

## Admin Panel Functionality

### Question Editing

The admin panel allows:

1. **Text Modification**: Edit question wording without changing scoring
2. **Weight Adjustment**: Modify question weights (0.5× to 2.0×)
3. **Dimension Reassignment**: Move questions between dimensions
4. **Reverse-Score Toggle**: Switch scoring direction
5. **Academic Construct Notes**: Document research basis

### Scoring Integrity

Changes that maintain validity:
- Text edits that preserve construct measurement
- Weight adjustments within reasonable range
- Adding reverse-scored items

Changes that may affect validity:
- Removing many questions from a dimension
- Extreme weight modifications
- Changing dimension assignments without construct review

### Export/Import

Questions can be exported as JSON for:
- Backup
- Version control
- Academic review
- Translation preparation

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React 18 with Vite 5
- Pure CSS (no frameworks)
- Client-side only (no server storage of results)

### AI Integration
- Anthropic Claude API for personalized analysis
- Fallback to pre-written cold readings if API unavailable

### Privacy
- No server-side result storage
- Email captured for marketing (optional)
- All scoring computed client-side

## Deployment Recommendation

### For marquisdemayfair.com (Shopify)

Since Shopify restricts custom JavaScript applications:

**Recommended**: Deploy to subdomain
```
quiz.marquisdemayfair.com
```

**Steps**:
1. Deploy React app to Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages
2. Add CNAME DNS record pointing subdomain to deployment
3. Link from Shopify navigation
4. Integrate email capture with Klaviyo

### API Security

Never expose Anthropic API key in frontend. Create serverless function:

```javascript
// /api/generate-analysis.js (Vercel/Netlify function)
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
      "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(req.body)
  });
  return res.json(await response.json());
}
```
