## 1. Statement of Originality

### 1.1 Copyright Independence Declaration

**The Marquis de Mayfair Persona Assessment contains NO content derived from, copied from, or adapted from BDSMtest.org or any other existing BDSM assessment tool.**

Our assessment is developed through:
- Original question composition based on academic psychological constructs
- Independent dimension definitions derived from peer-reviewed literature
- Novel archetype conceptualization using historical and mythological frameworks
- Unique scoring algorithms developed from psychometric first principles

### 1.2 Development Process

Each question in our assessment follows this development process:

1. **Construct Identification**: We identify psychological constructs from peer-reviewed literature (e.g., "power motivation" from McClelland, 1975; "transformed pain" from Dunkley et al., 2020)

2. **Operationalization**: We write original items that operationalize these constructs for self-report measurement

3. **Review & Refinement**: Questions are reviewed for clarity, face validity, and social desirability bias resistance

4. **Weight Assignment**: Each question receives a weight (0.8× to 1.5×) based on its centrality to the measured construct

### 1.3 Legal Position

Our work is protected as original intellectual property because:
- All 64 questions are original compositions
- Our dimension names, while describing similar psychological territory, use distinct terminology
- Our archetype framework (historical/mythological parallels) is unique to our brand
- Our scoring algorithm is independently developed
- Our product recommendation engine is proprietary

## 3. Question Development Methodology

### 3.1 Construct-First Approach

Unlike assessments that may have evolved organically from community discussions, our questions are developed using a **construct-first methodology**:

1. **Theoretical Grounding**: Each question begins with identification of a measurable psychological construct from academic literature

2. **Behavioral Anchoring**: Questions ask about specific thoughts, feelings, or behavioral tendencies rather than abstract self-categorizations

3. **Dimensional Measurement**: Each question measures a continuous dimension, not a categorical presence/absence

### 3.2 Question Categories

Our 64 questions are distributed across these construct categories:

| Category | Description | Example Construct |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Power Orientation | Direction of power preference | Directive sexuality |
| Sensation Processing | Relationship with physical intensity | Transformed pain |
| Restraint Dynamics | Bondage-related preferences | Mindfulness through restriction |
| Visibility Preferences | Exhibition/observation dynamics | Display behaviors |
| Relational Configuration | Ongoing power exchange patterns | 24/7 dynamics |
| Role Expression | Fluidity and service orientation | Role fluidity |

### 3.3 Linguistic Principles

Our questions follow these linguistic guidelines:

- **First-person framing**: "I find..." rather than "You find..."
- **Present tense**: Current orientation rather than past behavior
- **Conditional phrasing**: "would feel" for hypothetical scenarios
- **Non-judgmental tone**: No language implying one response is better
- **Adult directness**: Explicit but not crude terminology
- **Sex-positive framing**: All orientations presented as valid expressions

### 3.4 Example Question Development

**Target Construct**: Consensual control over partner's orgasm (from orgasm control dynamics literature)

**Academic Basis**: Research on anticipatory pleasure through restriction; dopamine-mediated arousal patterns

**Draft Question**: "I find arousal in controlling when my partner is permitted to experience orgasm"

**Refinement**: "The thought of a partner begging for permission to orgasm, with that power entirely in my hands, is intensely arousing."

**Weight Assignment**: 1.5× (high centrality to dominance construct)

**Directness Rating**: Explicit (appropriate for adult assessment)

## 4. Psychometric Framework

### 4.1 Response Scale

We use a 5-point Likert scale:

1. Strongly Disagree
2. Disagree
3. Neutral
4. Agree
5. Strongly Agree

This follows standard psychometric practice for attitudinal measurement.

### 4.2 Weighted Scoring

Each question carries an individual weight based on:

| Weight | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 0.8× | Peripheral indicator of dimension |
| 1.0× | Standard indicator |
| 1.2× | Moderate centrality |
| 1.3× | High face validity |
| 1.4× | High discriminant validity |
| 1.5× | Core/defining indicator |

### 4.3 Reverse-Scored Items

Approximately 15% of questions are reverse-scored (designed as in our database with `isReversed: true`). This:
- Detects acquiescence bias
- Improves construct validity
- Increases respondent attention

### 4.4 Randomization

Questions are presented in randomized order for each respondent to:
- Prevent order effects
- Reduce pattern response
- Improve validity

---

## 5. Dimension Definitions

Our assessment measures 16 distinct dimensions, each grounded in academic research:

| Dimension | Code | Academic Basis | Complementary |
|-----------|------|----------------|---------------|
| Dominance | DOM | Power motivation (McClelland, 1975) | Submission |
| Submission | SUB | Psychological relief through power transfer (Yost & Hunter, 2012) | Dominance |
| Sensory Dominance | SAD | Transformed pain research (Dunkley et al., 2020) | Masochism |
| Sensory Reception | MAS | Endorphin-mediated altered states (Sagarin et al., 2009) | Sadism |
| Bondage Artistry | RIG | Flow states in skilled practice (Williams et al., 2016) | Rope Bottom |
| Bondage Reception | ROP | Mindfulness through restriction (Newmahr, 2010) | Rigger |
| Exhibition | EXH | Display behaviors and validation (Hébert & Weaver, 2014) | Voyeur |
| Witness | VOY | Observer dynamics in BDSM spaces (Connolly, 2006) | Exhibitionist |
| Primal Pursuit | HNT | Evolutionary psychology of pursuit | Primal Prey |
| Primal Flight | PRY | Fear-excitement arousal overlap (Sagarin et al., 2009) | Primal Hunter |
| Total Authority | OWN | 24/7 power exchange (Pitagora, 2016) | Property |
| Total Surrender | PRP | Ownership dynamics and attachment (Sprott & Benoit Hadcock, 2018) | Owner |
| Nurturing Authority | CG | Caregiving dynamics (Baker, 2018) | Dependent |
| Nurtured State | DEP | Therapeutic regression (Sprott, 2020) | Caregiver |
| Role Fluidity | SWT | Role fluidity research (Martinez, 2018) | None |
| Devotional Service | SRV | Service orientation studies (Weiss, 2006) | None |

## 6. Scoring Algorithm

### 6.1 Dimension Score Calculation

```
For each dimension d:
  rawScore[d] = Σ (response[q] × weight[q]) for all questions q in dimension d
  
  If question is reversed:
    response[q] = 6 - originalResponse[q]
  
  maxPossible[d] = Σ (5 × weight[q]) for all answered questions in d
  
  normalizedScore[d] = (rawScore[d] / maxPossible[d]) × 100
```

### 6.2 Archetype Assignment

Primary archetype is determined by highest-scoring dimension:

```
primaryDimension = argmax(normalizedScore[d]) for all d
primaryArchetype = archetypeMapping[primaryDimension]

secondaryDimension = second-highest scoring dimension
secondaryArchetype = archetypeMapping[secondaryDimension]
```

### 6.3 Cross-Dimension Analysis

For AI-generated analysis, we consider dimension interactions:

- **Complementary pairs**: High scores in both dominance and caregiver suggest "nurturing authority"
- **Tension pairs**: High scores in both dominance and submission indicate "switch" orientation
- **Intensity markers**: High sensation scores (both giving/receiving) suggest intensity-seeking personality

### 7.2 Cold Reading Principles

Our archetype descriptions use validated cold reading techniques:

1. **Rainbow Ruse**: Describe opposing traits as coexisting ("You appear confident, but inside...")
2. **Barnum Statements**: Universally applicable insights that feel personal
3. **Flattery**: Emphasize positive qualities and unique gifts
4. **Validation**: Affirm that their orientation is meaningful and valuable
5. **Growth Path**: Suggest evolution and development possibilities

## 8. Product Recommendation Engine

### 8.1 Category Mapping

Each archetype maps to product categories from marquisdemayfair.com:

```javascript
archetypeToCategories = {
  sovereign: ['impact', 'restraints', 'collars_leashes'],
  devotee: ['restraints', 'collars', 'sensory'],
  artisan: ['impact', 'sensation'],
  phoenix: ['impact', 'sensation', 'restraints'],
  // ... etc
}
```

### 8.2 Product Selection Logic

Products are selected based on:
1. Primary archetype category match
2. Secondary archetype influence
3. Dimension intensity scores
4. Complementary product pairing

### 8.3 Recommendation Presentation

## 9. Validity Considerations

### 9.1 Face Validity

Our questions have high face validity—respondents can see the connection between the question and what is being measured. This is appropriate for self-exploration tools.

### 9.2 Content Validity

Questions are derived from academic constructs, ensuring content validity across the domain of power exchange psychology.

### 9.3 Limitations

We acknowledge these limitations:

1. **Self-Report Bias**: All self-report measures are subject to social desirability and self-insight limitations

2. **No Clinical Validation**: This is a self-exploration tool, not a diagnostic instrument

3. **Temporal Variability**: Sexual orientation and preferences may evolve over time

4. **Context Dependency**: Responses may vary based on current partner, mood, or life circumstances

5. **Population Specificity**: Developed for English-speaking adults exploring consensual power dynamics

---

## 10. Ethical Framework

### 10.1 Consent-Centered Design

All dimensions presume and celebrate consensual adult expression. The assessment is designed for adults 18+ who are willingly exploring their intimate psychology.

### 10.2 Non-Pathologizing Language

Consistent with DSM-5's distinction between paraphilia (atypical interest) and paraphilic disorder (causing distress or harm), we:
- Use affirming language throughout
- Present all orientations as valid expressions
- Avoid clinical or diagnostic terminology

### 10.3 Privacy Protection

- All scoring occurs client-side (in-browser)
- No results are stored server-side
- Email capture is optional and for marketing purposes only
- Users can retake the assessment anonymously

### 10.4 Inclusivity

- Gender-neutral language throughout
- All sexual orientations welcomed
- No assumption of relationship structure
- Accessible design principles applied
